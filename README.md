3 ZPM Hub

This version of the ZPM hub uses a printed push relase catch to raise and lower the ZPM's
included in the files is a jig to help with bending the wire the correct length and drawings of the wire and required spring which i originaly got off Ebay.
For my hub I printed the ZPM's at a thickness of 0.7mm and the are lit form underneath by a 33000mcd 5mm LED.
The base lights are lit by a total of six 1000mcd 3mm LED's.
The latches are secured in place with M2x8mm screws, the treads for these screws are printed into the platform.
The text on the base says "We are the ancients" "3 ZPM" "This is the source of our power"
