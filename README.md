3 ZPM Hub

This version of the ZPM hub uses a printed push relase catch to raise and lower the ZPM's
included in the files is a jug to help with bending the wire the correct length and drawings of the wire and required spring which i originaly got off Ebay.
For my hub I printed the ZPM's at a thickness of 0.7mm and the are lit form underneath by a 33000mcd 5mm LED.
The base lights are lit by a total of six 1000mcd 3mm LED's
